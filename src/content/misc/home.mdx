## About
Hey there! I‘m Max, a high school student with a passion for programming and learning. Currently diving into the world of web development with React, while also eager to explore Rust and Swift. When I‘m not coding, you‘ll probably find me buried in APUSH or AP Stats textbooks, or maybe debating the intricacies of government and politics in APGOV. AP English Language keeps me sharp with words, but it‘s the thrill of problem-solving in AP Computer Science Principles that really gets me going. Join me on my journey as I navigate through the exciting realms of technology, history, and beyond!
