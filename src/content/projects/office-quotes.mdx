## OfficeQuotes: A Modern Take on a Classic

Welcome to OfficeQuotes, a brand new way to explore the hilarious and iconic quotes from the beloved TV show "The Office". As a huge fan of the show, I was frustrated with the outdated and slow experience of the original [officequotes.net](https://officequotes.net) site. That's why I decided to take matters into my own hands and create a modern, searchable platform to easily find your favorite quotes.
