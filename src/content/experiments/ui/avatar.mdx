## Additions
This component adds the AvatarGroup, AvatarGroupList, and AvatarOverflowIndicator components. They can be used to create a list of avatars that displays nicely like the one in the example above.

## Credits
This component was modified by [carstenlebek](https://github.com/carstenlebek) (and later me) and submitted as a [pull request](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui/pull/503) to the official [shadcn-ui/ui](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui) repo. It has been included here because it has not been merged into the official repo yet, but is required for some other components here (on top of just being an excellent component).
