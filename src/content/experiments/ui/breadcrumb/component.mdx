## Additions
The breadcrumb component is based off of the [shadcn/ui component](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/breadcrumb) of the same name. It has, however, seen one notable addition. That being the BreadcrumbGroup component. This component provides all of the functionality that you could want, while significantly simplifying the code.

## Usage
```tsx {5-9}
import { BreadcrumbGroup } from 'path/to/component';

export function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <BreadcrumbGroup items={[
      { title: 'Home', href: '/' },
      { title: 'Page 1', href: '/page1' },
      { title: 'Page 2', href: '/page2' }
    ]} />
  )
}
```
