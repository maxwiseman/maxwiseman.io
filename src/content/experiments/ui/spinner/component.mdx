## Credits
This component was made by [olekbaran](https://github.com/olekbaran) and submitted as a [pull request](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui/pull/1583) to the official [shadcn-ui/ui](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui) repo. It has been included here because it has not been merged into the official repo yet, but is required for some other components here (on top of just being an excellent component).
